# finger

**finger** is a modern **finger-protocol** **client**.

## Try It Out

Once you have `finger` installed, try running this command:
```
finger reiver@plan.cat
```

Although there are other ways you can use `finger`— in most case, you are probably going to use `finger` in this way.
But just with a different query.

For example, here is a similar example usage of `finger` but with a different query (of the same `user@host` type):
```
finger charles@finger.farm
```

## Usage

Here is how, in general, you can use `finger`:

```
finger [/switch] [user][@host…]
```
